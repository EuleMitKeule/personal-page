# Welcome!

My name is Lennard Beers, I am a student of Applied Computer Science at the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany. My favorite research topics include game development, object oriented software architecture and home automation.

I grew up in a small town near the city of Hamburg in northern Germany where I graduated from high school in the physics profile. From early on
I was very interested in computers and software development. After graduation I decided to move to the Ruhr Valley, where I currently reside, to study computer science.

In my free time I like to play the guitar, direct and edit short films with my friends and work at and use my home media server. I also love to work on smart home automations and develop games with or without the Unity Engine.
